            and check the postpone checkbox. Know you can select a date and time.</p>

            the text between <strong>&lt;readmore&gt;YOUR TEXT&lt;/readmore&gt;</strong>.</p>

            <p>At the top of the editor you can see up to three tabs. The <i>Article editor</i> tab is always visible and includes
            the editor as is. Additional tabs can be <i>Comments</i> and <i>Revisions</i></p>

            <p>The <i>Comments</i> tab allows you to manage comments created on the currently opened article. You can edit, delete,
            approve comments or set them as private. If you don't see this tab, you might have no permissions.</p>

            in system options and managed in the <i>Revisions</i> tab.</p>

        <p>The <i>filemanager</i> allows you to manage all uploaded images you are using in your articles. A simplyfied view is
        available when opend in the article editor. The filemanager shows you a list of all images with a thumbnail and allows
        you to perform a few actions like deletion, creating new thumbnails and rename images.</p>
        <p>To upload an image, select the upload files tab. This tab has two different modes, which can be changed in system settings.</p>
        <p>The first one is multiple file uploader based on jQuery, which is less resticted then a second mode. The second mode
        uses a classic HTML form and PHP upload combination, which can be used if your're using an older browser or have other problems
        with the jQuery uploader.</p>
        <p><b>How to insert an image into an article?</b></p>
        <p>To insert the source path of an image, use the button <span class="fpcm-ui-button">Insert image url</span> or
        <span class="fpcm-ui-button">Insert thumbnail url</span>, depending on what you want to insert into your article.</p>
        <p>You also can click right on both buttons and copy the source link and insert it into the source field in the Imser image
        dialog. The HTML editor view uses an autocompletion in the source field. Just start typing the file name. TinyMCE includes an
        option called "Image list" where you can select an image.</p>

            HL_MODULES
        </headline>
        <text>
        <![CDATA[
            <p>The <b>Modules</b> area allows you to manage installed and available module including updates and so on.
            Depeding on teh amount of used events, classes, etc. modules and extend functionality of FanPress CM.</p>
            <p>When your host allows external connections to other servers (see dashboard conatainer of system check),
            managing modules is pretty easy. In case you have to install/ update modules, use the "Install module manually" tab.
            Simply select the module ZIP archive file and start the upload. The package will be automaticaly extracted into the correct
            subfolder in "fanpress/inc/modules". If an uploaded module is not installed, it's install action will be called otherwise
            the update instructions will be executed.</p>
            <p>You can manage every module using the buttons in front of the module name. The visible buttons depend on the module
            manager roll permissions. Non-admin users should NOT have access to settings to manage modules. If you want to perform
            an action to various modules at the same time, check the boxes at the end on a line and select the action your want to
            execute at the right bottom.</p>
            <p>Modul authors can define module <b>dependencies</b>, which means a selected module requires other modules to be enabled
            and usable. The button <span class="fpcm-ui-button"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-alert"></span></span> at the beginning of a
            module line informs you about dependency errors. See module description for further information.</p>
