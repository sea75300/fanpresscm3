        <p>The first one is multiple file uploader based on jQuery, which is less resticted then a second mode. The second mode

        with the jQuery uploader.</p>

        </headline>
        <text>
        <![CDATA[
            <p>The <b>Modules</b> area allows you to manage installed and available module including updates and so on.
            Depending on the amount of used events, classes, etc. modules and extend functionality of FanPress CM.</p>
            <p>When your host allows external connections to other servers (see dashboard container of system check),
            managing modules is pretty easy. In case you have to install/ update modules, use the "Install module manually" tab.
            Simply select the module ZIP archive file and start the upload. The package will be automatically extracted into the correct
            subfolder in "fanpress/inc/modules". If an uploaded module is not installed, it's install action will be called otherwise
            the update instructions will be executed.</p>
            <p>You can manage every module using the buttons in front of the module name. The visible buttons depend on the module
            manager roll permissions. Non-admin users should NOT have access to settings to manage modules. If you want to perform
            an action to various modules at the same time, check the boxes at the end on a line and select the action your want to
            execute at the right bottom.</p>
            <p>Module authors can define module <b>dependencies</b>, which means a selected module requires other modules to be enabled
            and usable. The button <span class="fpcm-ui-button"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-alert"></span></span> at the beginning of a
            module line informs you about dependency errors. See module description for further information.</p>
            <p>In case you want to create an own module, check the <a href="https://nobody-knows.org/download/fanpress-cm/tutorial-zum-schreiben-eines-moduls/">Tutorial</a>
            and our <a href="http://updates.nobody-knows.org/fanpress/docs_fpcm3/">class documentation</a>.
